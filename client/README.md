This project is a web-based Blackjack game. The project has been made using vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I am attempting to deploy the project using Netlify and 
plan on implementing a database to store the highest scores from users over the web. As of now, the base client application is playable, but no data is stored on any database of any kind.
I hope to eventually turn this into a short full stack application.
